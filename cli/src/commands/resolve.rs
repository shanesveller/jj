/// Resolve a conflicted file with an external merge tool

/// Only conflicts that can be resolved with a 3-way merge are supported. See
/// docs for merge tool configuration instructions.
///
/// Note that conflicts can also be resolved without using this command. You may
/// edit the conflict markers in the conflicted file directly with a text
/// editor.
//  TODOs:
//   - `jj resolve --editor` to resolve a conflict in the default text editor. Should work for
//     conflicts with 3+ adds. Useful to resolve conflicts in a commit other than the current one.
//   - A way to help split commits with conflicts that are too complicated (more than two sides)
//     into commits with simpler conflicts. In case of a tree with many merges, we could for example
//     point to existing commits with simpler conflicts where resolving those conflicts would help
//     simplify the present one.
